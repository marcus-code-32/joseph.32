🧩 Problem 3: K-Group Merge and Reverse
You are given two sorted linked lists A and B and an integer k.

Process:

Merge the two lists into one sorted list

Then reverse every consecutive group of size k

If the final group has length < k, keep it as is

Return the head of the resulting list.

Example:
A: 1 → 3 → 5 → 7
B: 2 → 4 → 6 → 8
k = 3
Merged: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8
Result: 3 → 2 → 1 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 7 → 8

Constraints:
• N ≤ 2×10⁵
• O(1) extra memory
• Must remain stable merge order during merging
