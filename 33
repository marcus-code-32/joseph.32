ðŸ§© Problem 3: Group Words That Are Anagrams

Description:
Given an array of strings, group all the anagrams together.
Return the result as a list of groups.

Example:

Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]  
Output: [["eat","tea","ate"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]]


Explanation:
Words with the same sorted characters form one group.

Hint:
Use a HashMap where the key is the sorted version or character frequency tuple of the word.
