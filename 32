1. Next Greater Element II

Concepts: Stack, Circular Array

Problem:
Given a circular array, find the Next Greater Number for every element.
The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its right, considering the array circularly (after the last element, the array wraps back to the first).

Example:

Input: nums = [1, 2, 1]
Output: [2, -1, 2]
Explanation:
For 1, the next greater element is 2.
For 2, there is no next greater element, so -1.
For the last 1, the next greater element is 2 (since the array is circular).


Hint:
Use a monotonic stack that keeps indexes of elements. Traverse the array twice (simulate circularity).
