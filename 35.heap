ðŸ§© Problem 1: Longest Subarray with Equal 0s and 1s

Description:
Given a binary array (containing only 0 and 1), find the length of the longest subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.

Example:

Input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  
Output: 6  


Explanation:
The subarray [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1] has 3 zeros and 3 ones.

Hint:

Convert 0 â†’ -1.

Use a HashMap to store prefix sum and its first occurrence.

If the prefix sum repeats, subarray between them has equal 0s and 1s.
