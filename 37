ðŸ§© Problem 2: Reorder by Node Value Parity

Description:
Given a linked list, reorder it such that all even-valued nodes appear before odd-valued nodes, but maintain the original relative order within each group.

Example:

Input: 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 8  
Output: 4 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7


Explanation:
Even values: 4, 2, 8
Odd values: 1, 5, 7
Combine â†’ even list first, then odd list

Hint:
You can maintain two dummy heads â€” one for even and one for odd â€” and link them at the end.
