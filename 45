Problem 1: Count Valid BST Replacements
You are given a Binary Search Tree and a list of k distinct new values.
You may replace exactly one node’s value in the tree with one of the new values.
Your job is to return the number of replacements that would still keep the tree a valid BST.

Details that make this spicy:
• Parent-child ordering must hold
• Global ordering must hold
• You must check proper in-range constraints
• Node count up to 2×10⁵
• k up to 10⁵

This demands:
• Track min-max valid ranges for every node
• Efficient binary search to check ea
