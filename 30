Concepts: Queue, BFS (Breadth-First Search)

Problem:
You are given a grid representing oranges:

0 → empty cell

1 → fresh orange

2 → rotten orange


Every minute, each rotten orange turns adjacent fresh oranges (up, down, left, right) rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes until all oranges become rotten, or -1 if impossible.


Input: grid = [
  [2,1,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,1]
]
Output: 4
