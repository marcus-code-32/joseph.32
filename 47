   Problem 3: Binary Search Tree Distance Queries (Dynamic) Given an initially empty BST, you perform m operations
   : "I x": insert value x "D x": delete value x (if exists) "Q a b": query distance 
   (#edges) between nodes with values a and b If either a or b not present 
return -1. m ≤ 2×10⁵ All values ≤ 10⁹ Insert/delete must maintain BST structure
