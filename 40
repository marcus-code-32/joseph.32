ðŸ§© Problem 2: Remove Nodes Forming Desc Direction You are given a singly linked list. 
Remove every node that has a next node with a strictly greater value. ðŸ‘‰ Idea: A node should stay only 
if no value to its right is greater. Example: Input: 10 â†’ 5 â†’ 7 â†’ 3 â†’ 9 â†’ 1 Right-side max check: 10 stays 
(no greater on right at start) 5 removed (7 > 5 exists) 7 stays (9 > 7 exists â†’ remove 7?) â†’ Actually 9 exists 
on right â†’ yes remove 3 removed (9 > 3) 9 stays 1 stays (no greater on right) Output: 10 â†’ 9 â†’ 1 for this as well
