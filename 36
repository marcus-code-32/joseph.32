ðŸ§© Problem 3: Rotate in Pairs of K

Description:
You are given a linked list and an integer k.
Reverse the list in groups of 2 nodes at a time, but rotate the positions of every alternate group by k positions to the right.

Example:

Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], k = 1  
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 8, 7, 6, 5]


Explanation:

Reverse in pairs: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8) â†’ [2,1,4,3,6,5,8,7]

Then rotate every alternate group (like 3rd, 5th, etc.) by k

Hint:
Think in chunks: use a helper to reverse k nodes, and keep track of groups.
