🧩 Problem 1: Group Alternating Flip

Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k.

Process the list in groups of size k:

If the group index is odd (1st, 3rd, 5th…), keep order as is

If the group index is even (2nd, 4th, 6th…), reverse that group

If the final group has size < k, leave it unchanged.

Example:

Input:
List = 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9
k = 3

Groups: [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]
Output: 1 → 2 → 3 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 7 → 8 → 9

Constraints:

1 ≤ k ≤ 1000

1 ≤ List length ≤ 10⁵

O(1) extra space
